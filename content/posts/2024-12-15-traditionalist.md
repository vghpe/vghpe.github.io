At The Game Awards 2024 Naughty Dog revealed Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. I thought the setup, concept, presentation and music was great. But a lot of people were very very angry apparently. 

Why? Well, the culture war is confusing and it can be hard to pull out the true grievances from the layers of memes, obsession over like/dislike ratios, and content creators with questionable motives who financially benefit from outrage.

Here's is an attempt to catalogue a list of what's being said on Reddit, X, Youtube and Instagram. I ignored anything that seemed purely spiteful and focused on repeating patterns.
